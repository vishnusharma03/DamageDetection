# Damage Detection

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of training and deploying a machine learning model for detecting car damages using YOLOv8. The model is trained on a custom dataset of car damages, including scratches, dents, and other common issues. The containerized model is pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and deployed using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

This project demonstrates how to import a custom ML model to AWS & deploy it.
